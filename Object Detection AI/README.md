# Object Detection AI 📸🔍

Object Detection AI is a deep learning project that detects objects in images using a pre-trained deep learning model.

## Features 🚀

- Uses a deep learning model (e.g., MobileNet SSD or YOLO) for object detection.
- Classifies objects from a given image.
- Provides confidence scores for each detected object.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The model is pre-trained on a dataset and fine-tuned for object detection.
2. It processes an image and predicts the detected object along with a confidence score.
3. Users can input an image and receive predictions for detected objects.

## Requirements 🛠️

Ensure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow
```

## Usage 📷

Import the function and detect objects:

```python
from object_detection_ai import detect_objects

print(detect_objects("test_image.jpg"))  # Example usage
```
